   <h1>Made it to my first html page</h1>
    <p>My name is Nannsereko Housnah. I'm a form-six vacist from Nabisunsa Girls' School. This my 2week journey earning html and CSS at refactory by Saamson Kapeyi.
        it started with introduction ofcourse. "Mr.Samson Kapeyi being my teacher for this two week-module."It started off neat
        and easy.</p>
        <p> I was like one of those students that had gone to coaching dueing the holidays. </p>
        I even raised my hand and answered some question. Generally I was "bad" and I liked seeing myself like this. Not until we began i hear "git-hub" did I start to 
        question what had taken me to a class of alraedy experienced people. I hear "yeah i have a degree from Makerere"
        yeah..."i Did that when i did my internship" and so on". 
        <p>When I started this course I knew its wasnt going to be easy
        but little did I know it was going to be this hard for me either.I must say I underestimated this war I waged against my 
        brain and body. I was not used to being early in the morning as I was busy vacationing hard. </p>
        <p>1pm was my standard time 
        and my body had been accustomed to it. But it didnt take one to be in Michaels growth and development class to see
        that for me to survive these lessons and make some actual change for myself I was dwelling in the wrong quadrant of life
        instead I had to balance all the four out. Week one was easy-peasy lemon-squeazy for me but week two deemed a challenge
        with ever passing day me looking at new things. What helped me was the classes being recorded. </p>
